Group Members : Tanmay Patil(21104048), Miheet Shah(21104085), Shrusti Patil(21104012)

Description of the Project :

As a college community, we strive to create a supportive and inclusive environment where
everyone can thrive academically, socially, and personally. However, we understand that
sometimes things may not go as smoothly as we hoped, and issues may arise that need to
be addressed promptly. To ensure that every member of our community has a voice, we
have set up a complaint box. This box is designed to provide a safe and confidential space
for you to share any concerns or grievances you may have regarding any aspect of college
life. Whether it be a problem with a professor, staff member, or fellow student, we want to
hear from you
